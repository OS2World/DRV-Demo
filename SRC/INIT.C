/* have it addressable by CS.  To do this, the entry point must be stored in */
/* the CODE segment.  But, the CODE segment is not writable.  Therefore, an  */
/* alias selector (Data, Writeable) must be created.  Another problem is     */
/* that to do this uses for calls to DevHlp. So, the basic steps are:        */
/* 1. Store the DevHlp entry point in a temporary location in the Data Seg   */
/* 2. Get the physical address of the DevHlp storage location in the Code    */
/*    segment.  This uses the temporary DevHlp caller that uses the DevHlp   */
/*    entry point stored in the DATA segment                                 */
/* 3. Make an LDT based pointer to the physical address gotten in step 2.    */
/*    This two uses the temporary DevHlp caller                              */
/* 4. Store the DevHlp entry point in the address gotten in step 3.  From    */
/*    this point on, we can use the CS based DevHlp caller.                  */
/* 5. Free the LDT selector slot used in steps 2 and 3.                      */
/*                                                                           */
/* The reason for using CS as the segment pointer to the DevHlp entry point  */
/* is that CS is the only segment always available.  Some DevHlp calls use   */
/* DS and others use ES, the SS and CS are the only ones left.  I chose to   */
/* pay the price at INIT time and store the entry in CS, and not always      */
/* pass it in the stack (which, by the way is a perfectly valid way to do    */
